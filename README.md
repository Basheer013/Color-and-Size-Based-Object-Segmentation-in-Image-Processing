This is a color and size based object segmentation in image processing
Abstract:
Object segmentation based on color and size is a fundamental task in imageprocessing with applications in various fields such as computer vision, robotics, andindustrial automation. This project aims to develop a robust systemfor detectingandsegmenting objects in an image based on their color and size. The proposed methodleverages color space transformation, thresholding techniques, and contour detectionto isolate objects of interest from the background. By converting the image fromtheRGB color space to the HSV color space, the system can more effectively identifyobjects based on their hue, saturation, and value. Morphological operations are thenapplied to enhance the segmentation results and eliminate noise. The contours of thedetected objects are analyzed to extract size-related features, enabling theclassification of objects based on predefined size criteria. The implementation of this project is carried out using Python and OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using a diverse set of test images with varying colors and object sizes. The results demonstrate thesystem's capability to accurately detect and segment objects based on color and size, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications such as quality control inmanufacturing, automated sorting systems, and object tracking in video surveillance. Future work will focus on enhancing the system's performance under different
lighting conditions and integrating machine learning techniques to improvesegmentation accuracy.
